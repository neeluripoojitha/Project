                STEPS TO EXECUTE CODE FILES


Steps to execute the Code

1. Install required software,such as Python
2. Install the libraries such as Scikit-learn,Scipy,Streamlit,Pandas,Pickle,pycodestyle  
3. Use a suitable Integrated Development Environment(IDE) like Visual Studio Code,PyCharm,orEclipse for coding,debugging and testing.
4. Set up linters like PyLint for Python, HTMLHINT for HTML, CSSLINT for CSS and JSHINT for JavaScript to analyze code quality and adherence to coding standards.
5. Load the Pre-Trained Models, such as word embeddings for NLP tasks or machine learning models for recommendation algorithms
6. Run the main.py, it will open the result in the browser.
7. After executing the code, select the programming language you want to code and start typing the code.
8. It shows the score and error messages and display the recommended code snippets.



Steps to execute Oral Code

1. Install the IDE you want to code like visual studio code.
2. Install the libraries using the command pip install "Library name".
3. Library Installation:
     -open the terminal
     -Install the required libraries using the following commands:
      pip install numpy
      pip install pandas
      pip install matplotlib
      pip install scikit-learn
      pip install streamlit
      pip install pycodestyle
      pip install pickle
4. Download the code dataset in four programming languages like Python, Java, CSS,JavaScript and combine these datasets and integrate the codes of HTML from github links.
5. Run the code to load data, preprocesss it,build the model,train the model,evaluate performance and save the model.
6. After running the code the results are displayed in the browser
7. Select the programming language you want to code, the default language is Python and start typing the code.
8. After writing the code press "Enter" and "Tab" to give the score and recommended code snippets.
